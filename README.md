# RevenuePredictor
This project aims to use a linear regression model to predict the revenues of US sourced products, processed directed from commodities sourced locally in the USA.  

# Dataset
The dataset is downloaded directly from https://revenuedata.doi.gov/downloads/revenue/ more specifically the monthly revenue report csv download.  Be sure to download the dataset if you plan to run the code, the dataset is too large to upload and include within the repository.

# Installing Required Libraries
install all necessary libraries by running 
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Running the Notebook
Open and execute the my_project.ipynb and run cell by cell. Be sure to have the data set downloaded in the same directory as the my_project.ipynb.  If there is an issue with the first cell be sure that the dataset is downloaded, saved and named correctly to match the path written in the my_project.ipynb.
